        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>God of War (commonly referred to as God of War 4[2][3][4]) is an upcoming third-person action-adventure video game
            in development by Santa Monica Studio and to be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE). It is scheduled
            to be released on April 20, 2018 for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) console. It will be the eighth installment in the
            God of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's God of War III. The game will be a soft
            reboot for the franchise and will take the series to the world of Norse mythologyâ€”all previous games were based
            on Greek mythology. Series protagonist Kratos will return as the main character, and he now has a son named Atreus.
            Kratos acts as a mentor and protector to his son, and has to master the rage that has driven him for many years.</p>
